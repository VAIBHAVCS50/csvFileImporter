Data analysts around the world 🌍, handle massive amounts of data to derive meaningful insights for their organization 📊. Among the tools they use, Google Sheets 📈 stands out due to its ease of use, accessibility, and collaborative features.

This repetitive, time-consuming task reduces the efficiency of these professionals and delays the extraction of crucial insights 😫.
